Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization
This project is a visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics. It allows users to interactively select nodes and visualize the shortest path between them.

Features

Interactive selection of start and end nodes

Visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm progress

Animation of pathfinding process

Graphical representation of nodes and edges

Dependencies

SFML library (>= 2.5.1)

usage 
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/xxabixxx/dijkstra-algorithm-visualization.git

Build the project:

cd dijkstra-algorithm-visualization

g++ main.cpp -o dijkstra -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system

Run the executable:

./dijkstra
Use the left mouse button to select start and end nodes. The algorithm will run and visualize the shortest path between them.
